# A mashup of Ant's react components and a wrapper around Mike Bostock's Barchart Race

This is a wrapper around the maestro Mike Bostock's bar chart race implementation on observable which you can find her:

converting observable code to react is not as easy as it may look because observable is not plain javascript.
